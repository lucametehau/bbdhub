Hello there!

I don't know if I will do a per week progress, but I'll try to keep an ordered (by time) list of my stuff:

- Implemented Piece Class
- Fixed some small bugs all around
- Implemented Attacks, needed for Move Generation
- Implemented Move Generation, fully working and fixed small bugs in the Board Class
- Add Search, start with Negamax.
- Add Alpha-Beta Pruning, pretty funny to see how much it reduces node count.
- Add UCI compatibility, so that we can test our changes via OpenBench.
- Add Quiescence Search.
- Implement Pesto Piece Square Tables evaluation, massive improvment.
- Add History Heuristic.
- Various fixes.
